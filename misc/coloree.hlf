@cmdline
$# Command line support
    You can use the plugin from FAR's command line with prefix 'clr:'
to view files with syntax highlighting in Colorer's internal viewer.
To view file you have to specify file name after the 'clr:' prefix
in FAR's command line. This function is equal to #colorer.exe# program
features, but doesn't load HRC database each time, so it works faster.

@add
$# Outliner
    Here you can see a list of all functions or syntax errors found.
Choose any item to go to corresponding line in text.
    
    You can use keyboard filter to quickly search for required items:

      Expand-Collapse level of Outliner

    #Ctrl-Up/Down#
      Move to next/previous item both in outliner and in source code

    #Ctrl-Enter#
      Close the outliner and insert current item into the cursor position
    
    #Enter#
      Close the outliner and jump to the selected item
