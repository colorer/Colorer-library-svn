This Midnight Commander build is modified to use
Colorer-take5 as a syntax highlighting engine in standard mc editor.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
For now just a simple syntax highlighting, brackets/paired constructions matching,
and current block selection.
</p>

<h2>Building and installing</h2>
<p>

Download it at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34855">sf.net download area</a>.<br/>
Source package allows you to rebuild it for any platform MC available on,
and Binary package contains Midnight Commander, compiled for i386 Linux (mdk10).
</p>
<p>
To install it you should have Colorer-take5-linux
already installed or unpacked somewere (however any form of its distribution is suitable).
</p>
<p>
MC binary is compiled with hardcoded /usr/ prefix,
so you should have MC already installed there
or recompile it from the source package with your prefix.
</p>
<p>
Next, just use the provided 'mc' binary to run it.
In case you have no root rights you can look
for the 'mclr.sh' script and fix it for yourself
to make it possible to run this MC mod from non-root account.
</p>

<h2>Whats new in 0.5?</h2>

<p>
Editor is now capable to show paired constructions, like it works in eclipse/far versions.<br/>
Moreover, two editor menu options were added:
Command/<code>"Select Block"</code> and <code>"Select Block Content"</code>.
<br/>
These allows you to mark with selection current paired construction.
<br/>
Of course, <code>"Go to matching Bracket"</code> (alt/meta-b) also works with Colorer.
</p>

<p>
There is no UI settings now, however you can manually change default color
style, colorer uses to highlight the text.
<br/>
To do this just add this section to your ~/.mc/ini file:
</p>

<pre>
[Colorer]
colorer_hrd_string=nc
</pre>

<p>
Changing it's value you can choose one of available HRD styles (see your
colorer/catalog.xml file for list of available styles).
