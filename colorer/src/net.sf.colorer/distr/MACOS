  You can compile Colorer Library to use it on MacOSX system.

  1. You need to download C++ sources of the Colorer Library from
     http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34855
     (Colorer-take5.beta3 package).

  Next, you need:

  2. Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)
  3. Xcode
  4. JDK
     a) jdk 1.4.2: http://connect.apple.com/, Downloads -> Java, Java Developper package
     b) jdk 1.4.1: MacOSX SDK from Xcode Tools CD.

  5. Check your makefile.macos:
     Make sure your JAVA_INCLUDE path is correct.

  6. You can build full Eclipse plugin distribution with
        ant -Dplatform=macos eclipseplugin
     command.

  Please read INSTALL file for more information.

  If you have no ANT or full JDK installed, you can compile only
  plugin's native part with
    make -f makefile.macos
  in the 'colorer/src/net.sf.colorer/libnative' folder and
  place it into 'os/macosx/ppc' folder of the existing EclipseColorer
  distribution package.
