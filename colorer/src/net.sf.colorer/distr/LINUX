  Colorer Library is not yet fully tested on Linux systems,
  and there can be some problems.

  The most annoying issue - conflicts between libstdc++ library versions,
  used by the Colorer and Sun's JDK 1.3/1.4.

  You can find this problem description on
    http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jsp?forum=52&thread=138362

  However, I can't solve it. The only way to resolve this problem
  is to recompile Colorer's native part with gcc 2.95.3.
  Another solution - use alternative Java Machines (Kaffe, Blackdown)

  Now Colorer doesn't uses dynamic_cast operator - anyway it continues
  to make faults when any internal C++ exception occurs.

  So, you can try to use it with care :-)
