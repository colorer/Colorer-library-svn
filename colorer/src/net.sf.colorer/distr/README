  This archive contains Java Edition of the Colorer-take5 library.

  It includes Java interfaces to the Library and an experimental
  plugin for the Eclipse platform
    http://www.eclipse.org

  To install plugin into Eclipse you have to copy content
  of this directory into %ECLIPSE_HOME%/plugins directory.

  This package contains plugin's native library, compiled for
  win32 ant Linux platforms. For Linux issues, read LINUX file.
  To compile Colorer-take5 library to use with MacOSX systems,
  read MACOS file.

  If you are using Colorer with other tools/applications (and have
  your own HRC base), you can specify path to the 'catalog.xml' file
  with one of the standard locations:
    - %HOME%/.colorer5catalog (or %HOMEPATH%, %SYSTEMROOT%)
    - %COLORER5CATALOG%
    - /usr/share/colorer/catalog.xml

  In this case you can delete 'colorer' folder of the EclipseColorer
  package, and it will start to read configuration data from the global source.
