  Colorer Library is not yet fully tested on Linux systems,
  and there can be some problems.

  This version of Colorer Library comes with the native part, compilied
  with GNU GCC 3.2.

  There could be problems related to not Sun VM usages, .so loading and others.
  Search forums for the resolution.

  I've tested it with Eclipse 3.2 (gtk) under jdk1.4.1 on Fedora 6 and it works fine.

  Fell free to ask or help (last is preferred).
