  Colorer Library is not yet fully tested on Linux systems,
  and there can be some problems.

  This version of Colorer Library comes with the native part, compilied
  with GNU GCC 3.2 c++ compiler under Mandrake Linux 9.0.

  I've tested it with Eclipse 2.1 (gtk) under jdk1.4.1 and it works fine.

  However, you can encounter some problems with library dependencies.
