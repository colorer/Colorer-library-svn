  This archive contains Java Edition of the Colorer-take5 library.

  It includes Java interfaces to the Library and a
  plugin for the Eclipse platform
    http://www.eclipse.org

  To install plugin into Eclipse you have to copy content
  of this directory into %ECLIPSE_HOME%/plugins directory.

  EclipseColorer is based on a native Colorer-take5 library,
  so each platform has its own native part library.
  By default the package contains plugin's stuff
  compiled for win32, Linux(x86) and MacOS platforms.

  For Linux issues, read LINUX file.
  For MacOs issues see MACOS file.

  If you are using Colorer with other tools/applications (and have
  your own HRC base), you can specify path to the 'catalog.xml' file
  with one of the standard locations:
    - %HOME%/.colorer5catalog (or %HOMEPATH%, %SYSTEMROOT%)
    - %COLORER5CATALOG%
    - /usr/share/colorer/catalog.xml

  In this case you can delete 'colorer' folder of the EclipseColorer
  package, and it will start to read configuration data from the global source.
