  You can compile Colorer Library to use it on MacOSX system.

  First, you need to download C++ sources of the Colorer Library from
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34855

  Then you can build full Eclipse plugin distribution with
    ant -Dplatform=macos eclipseplugin
  command.

  Please read INSTALL file for more information.

  If you have no ANT or full JDK installed, you can compile only
  plugin's native part with
    make -f makefile.macos
  in the 'colorer/src/net.sf.colorer/libnative' folder and
  place it into 'os/macosx/ppc' folder of the existing EclipseColorer
  distribution package.
