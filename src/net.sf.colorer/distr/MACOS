  MacOS Build provided with EclipseColorer was not tested at all (hope somebody will do it).
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  You can compile Colorer Library to use it on MacOSX system.

  You need to download C++ sources of the Colorer Library from
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34855
  (Colorer-take5.beta3 package).

  Next, you have two ways to build Colorer for MAC OS:

  I. Just build native part of the library:
     
     1. Go into 'colorer/src/net.sf.colorer/libnative' folder.
     2. Run
        make -f makefile.macos
     3. place libnet.sf.colorer.so into 'os/macosx/ppc' folder
        of the existing EclipseColorer distribution package.


  II. Build plugin package from scratch:

     1. Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)
     2. Xcode
     3. JDK
        a) jdk 1.4.2: http://connect.apple.com/, Downloads -> Java, Java Developper package
        b) jdk 1.4.1: MacOSX SDK from Xcode Tools CD.

     4. Check your src/net.sf.colorer/libnative/makefile.macos:
        Make sure your JAVA_INCLUDE path is correct.

     5. You can build full Eclipse plugin distribution with
           ant -Dplatform=macos eclipseplugin
        command.

  Please read INSTALL file for more information.
