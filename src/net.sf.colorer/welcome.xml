<item><b>Perspectives, views and editors </b>
<p>A window contains one or more perspectives. A perspective consists of views (e.g. Navigator)
and editors for working with your resources.
The shortcut bar at the far left of the window allows you to open new perspectives and move
between perspectives that are already open. The perspective you are currently working with
is shown in the title of the window and in the shortcut bar as a pushed-in icon.</p></item>

<item><b>Configuring your perspectives</b>
You can move views and editors around the workbench by dragging their titlebars. You can
also add more views to your current perspective by using Window > Show View.
To reset the perspective to its original state, choose
<action pluginId="org.eclipse.ui"
   class="org.eclipse.ui.internal.ResetPerspectiveAction">Window > Reset Perspective</action>.
Once you have arranged your perspective, you can save it using Window > Save Perspective As....
You can customize the views, perspectives and New menu operations that show up for
your perspective. To do this choose
<action pluginId="org.eclipse.ui"
   class="org.eclipse.ui.internal.EditActionSetsAction">Window > Customize Perspective...</action> .
A view can additionally be converted into a Fast View by dragging it to the shortcut bar (at the
far left of the window). </item>
