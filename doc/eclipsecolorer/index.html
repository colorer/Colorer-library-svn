<h1>Eclipse platform plugin</h1>
<p>Colorer Library introduces it's new version for the
<a href='http://www.eclipse.org'>Eclipse platform</a>.
Eclipse is a highly configurable and extensible IDE, written on Java.
It provides a great API for plugging external components, allowing
to use all it's powerful features.
Colorer implements multiprogramming language editor for the Eclipse platform.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install Colorer for Eclipse you must download
<code>EclipseColorer-take5.x.x.x.zip</code> package. This package contains
Eclipse plugin with sources, packed Colorer's HRC database and
two versions of native library component - for Windows and Linux platforms.
It contains sources both for native part and top-level Colorer Java API.
Note, that it doesn't contains sources of the Colorer Library. If you want
to rebuild native part of the plugin, you have to download latest Colorer Library
package.
</p>
<p>Unpack content of plugin's package into <code>%ECLIPSEHOME%/plugins/</code>
folder and restart Eclipse. Make sure you've extracted
<code>net.sf.colorer/colorer/</code> folder. It contains HRC database,
which is used by the plugin.
</p>
<p>You can choose another way to install colorer - using build-in
Eclipse Update Manager. Create new location
<strong>http://colorer.sf.net/eclipsecolorer/</strong> using update manager,
and Eclipse will allow you to automatically install EclipseColorer.
Later you can use this way to simply and efficiently update colorer and
check for its new versions.
</p>
<p>If you are already have Colorer-take5 Library, installed in your system
(f.e. from full library package version), you can delete <code>colorer</code>
directory and specify path to your <code>catalog.xml</code> file with one of the
<a href='../api/classParserFactory.html'>standard locations</a>.
</p>

<h2>Minor Notes</h2>
<p>EclipseColorer was tested with Eclipse v2.0.2, v2.1.0, v3.0M5, M6.
However, there are some differences in behavior of these versions.
For example, to manage Colorer's current line color in 2.1 and later,
you must disable line highlighting in global text editor settings.
Also, there are some differences in Eclipse API. In particular, Colorer
compiled with latest Eclipse can work with some bugs in previous version.
