<h1>Eclipse platform plugin</h1>
<p>
<img style="float: right;" src="eclipse.png" width="283" height="274"/>
Colorer Library introduces its plugin version for the
<a href='http://www.eclipse.org'>Eclipse platform</a>.
Eclipse is a highly configurable and extensible IDE, written on Java.
It provides a great API for plugging external components, allowing
to use all it's powerful features.
Colorer implements multiprogramming language editor with syntax highlighting for the Eclipse platform.

</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install Colorer for Eclipse you should have
EclipseColorer-take5.x.x.x.zip package.
</p>
<div class="download">
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34855&package_id=75558">Get EclipseColorer</a>
</div>
<p>
This package contains
EclipseColorer plugin with sources, packed Colorer's HRC database and
native library component.
It contains sources both for native part and top-level Colorer Java API.
Note, that it doesn't contains sources of the Colorer Library. If you want
to rebuild native part of the plugin, you have to download latest Colorer Library
development package.
</p>
<p>Unpack content of plugin's package into <code>%ECLIPSEHOME%/plugins/</code>
folder and restart Eclipse. Make sure you've extracted
<code>net.sf.colorer/colorer/</code> folder. It contains HRC database,
which is used by the plugin.
</p>

<p>
You can choose another way to install colorer - using build-in
<strong>Eclipse Update Manager</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Create new location
<strong>http://colorer.sf.net/eclipsecolorer/</strong> using update manager,
and Eclipse will allow you to automatically install EclipseColorer.
Later you can use this way to simply and efficiently update colorer and
check for its new versions.
</p>
<p>If you already have development Colorer-take5 Library installed in your system
(f.e. from full library package version), you can delete <code>colorer</code>
directory and specify path to your <code>catalog.xml</code> file with one of the
<a href='../api/classParserFactory.html'>standard locations</a>.
This way is useful for HRC development and for sole HRC catalog location.
</p>

<h2>Common features</h2>
<p>Colorer for Eclipse IDE supports:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Default Eclipse editor with syntax highlighting capabilities.<br/>
     This editor inherits from standard Eclipse Text Editor, thus allowing to use all
     default feature of Eclipse Editor. You can reuse all default short-cuts, all actions and so on.
     Note, that colorer knows nothing about Java Editor or CDT Editor, so you can't use their extended capabilities
     simultaneously with EclipseColorer.
