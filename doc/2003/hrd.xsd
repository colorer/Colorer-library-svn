      List of assigns between regions and their external properties.
      These properties commonly include text decoration parameters,
      such as color, style, font and so on...
      Global color layering model can be chosen by the target application,
      depending on its text presentation style, features and requirements.
      In general, all transparent colors must inherit color value from its
      parent schema color. If the current schema is a top-level, default
      fore- and back-ground colors are used.
      Default Colors could be stored in HRD, using standard default region
      'def:Text', or could be requested by application from the GUI environment.

      Single entry, describes region's properties.
      If entry is specified more than one time, then used the latest
      definition. This allows processing of several HRD files to
      complete color description of target HRC regions.

        Full qualified region name (a pair [type:name]).
        Note, that if region has no HRD properties associations,
        it inherits properties from its parent. If any of its
        ancestors has no assigned properties, region visualization
        must be skipped (it becomes fully transparent).
