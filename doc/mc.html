<h1>Midnight Commander mod with Colorer-take5 syntax engine</h1>

<p>
This release contains Midnight Commander modified to use
Colorer-take5 as a syntax highlighting engine.
</p>
<p>
Source package will allow you to rebuild it for any platform,
MC available on, and
Binary package contains Midnight Commander,
compiled for i386 Linux (mdk10).
</p>
<p>
To install it you should have Colorer-take5-linux
already installed or unpacked somewere
(however any form of its distribution is suitable).
</p>
<p>
MC binary is compiled with hardcoded /usr/ prefix,
so you should have MC already installed there
or recompile it from the source package with your prefix.
</p>
<p>
Next, just use the provided 'mc' binary to run it.
In case you have no root rights you can look
for the 'mclr.sh' script and fix it for yourself
to make it possible to run this MC mod from non-root account.
