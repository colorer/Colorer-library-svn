This Midnight Commander build is modified to use
Colorer-take5 as a syntax highlighting engine in standard mc editor.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
MC-Colorer supports all basic functionality you have already in Eclipse or FAR Colorer:
</p>
<ul>
<li>General syntax highlighting with all the features common HRC language base provides.</li>
<li>Brackets/paired constructions matching, jumping and block marking.</li>
<li>Plain outliner for the functions list.</li>
<li>Color styles runtime change with special dialog.</li>
<li>Syntax type selection dialog.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building and installing</h2>

<div class="download">
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34855&package_id=188547">Get MC-Colorer</a>
</div>

<p>
Source package allows you to rebuild it for any platform MC available on,
and Binary package contains Midnight Commander, compiled for <strong>i386 Linux</strong> (mdk10).
</p>
<ul>
<li>To install it you should have Colorer-take5-linux
already installed or unpacked somewere (however any form of its distribution is suitable).
</li>
<li>
MC binary was compiled with hardcoded <strong>/usr/</strong> prefix,
so you should have MC already installed there
or recompile it from the source package with your prefix.
</li>
<li>
Next, just use the provided <strong>'mc'</strong> binary to run it.
</li>
<li>
In case you have no root rights you can look
for the 'mclr.sh' script and fix it for yourself
to make it possible to run this MC mod from non-root account.

<h2>Whats new in MCColorer 0.9?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Color style selection dialog from MCEdit menu.</li>
<li>Outline dialog (<strong>Commands/Outline</strong> MCEdit menu).</li>
<li>Syntax selection dialog.</li>
<li>Upmerge with latest CVS MC revision.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Whats new in MCColorer 0.5?</h2>

<p>
Editor is now capable to show paired constructions, like it works in eclipse/far versions.<br/>
Moreover, two editor menu options were added:
Command/<code>"Select Block"</code> and <code>"Select Block Content"</code>.
<br/>
These allows you to mark with selection current paired construction.
<br/>
Of course, <code>"Go to matching Bracket"</code> (alt/meta-b) also works with Colorer.
</p>

<p>
There is no UI settings now, however you can manually change default color
style, colorer uses to highlight the text.
<br/>
To do this just add this section to your ~/.mc/ini file:
</p>

<pre>
[Colorer]
colorer_hrd_string=nc
</pre>

<p>
Changing it's value you can choose one of available HRD styles (see your
colorer/catalog.xml file for list of available styles).
