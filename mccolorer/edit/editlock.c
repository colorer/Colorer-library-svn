/* Locking scheme used in mcedit is based on a documentation found
   in JED editor sources. Abstract from lock.c file (by John E. Davis):

   The basic idea here is quite simple.  Whenever a buffer is attached to
   a file, and that buffer is modified, then attempt to lock the
   file. Moreover, before writing to a file for any reason, lock the
   file. The lock is really a protocol respected and not a real lock.
   The protocol is this: If in the directory of the file is a
   symbolic link with name ".#FILE", the FILE is considered to be locked
   by the process specified by the link.
