colorer.log:

error: duplicate scheme name 'yml:xmlss-uri-elementContent'
error: unqualified name 'perfomace_type-element' doesn't belong to any imported type [I:\WORK\colorer\main\colorer\hrc/auto\gen/yml.hrc]
error: cannot resolve scheme name 'perfomace_type-element' in scheme 'yml:_hrc_int_d12e53-content'
(Only Yandex scheme is left. This is my fault ...
UPD: It's not the scheme - there is a bug in xsd2hrc, because of which xmlss duplicated ...)


«1. for r1273 we should cancel point 2 and remake it the other way - add to xml type wxs and fb2 extensions» -
it will be necessary to create own schemes for them... UPD: wxs will wait until the new converter, through xsd2hrc its
impossible to do it correctly... UPD2: fb2 can wait too. xsd2hrc is obsolete, there is no desire to do anything complicated
with it now. Need to write a new converter. And be quick, while I still have resource for this...


- doclinks are not highlighed in colore files. Add? UPD: after, if there is a need
- clarify the state of xpointer.hrc. I remember exactly that I once did it. Or was just going to do?
(UPD: found it half-written in the 2006 archives. And I'm not sure if it is needed. UPD2: not needed now for sure)


With far.hrc and its macro situation is unclear... While the exact syntax is not known - it can't be helped.

	4) The contents of tags \p1, \p2, \p4 can have negative values
	6) Tags \p1, \p2, \p4 can be in any position among other tags, not only in the last
	7) Add tags \fax and \fay to paint them with another color, because they need a fairly recent version of the subtitle renderer
